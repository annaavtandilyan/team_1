# 1. Locators in product_page.py is not effective, need to improve
# Thats good that you keep price and brand in test_data.py, but you could use that data in locators as well.
# e.g.: write brand and price locators In functions where you use them

# And then in the test case you can call the function with the data from test_data.py
# I changed assert in test cases, the main issue was that you used assert without all() function 
# which is not correct because without all() functionthe expression inside the assertion will become a generator expression,
#  which is always True. So, I added all() function to the assert statements.
# I removed checking of price range in the result. Just checked that the price is less than 200.00 (will be better not hardcode price in the test)
